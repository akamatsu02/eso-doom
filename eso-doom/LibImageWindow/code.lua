idea:
	a label can have 128 color codes, maybe there is a monospace font with no gaps between the characters and just a black square as character (like: https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+25A0)
	for a screen of 128 x 64 pixels we can put 64 labels below each other and handle the horizontal pixels with the text content of the label (and also the coloring here)
